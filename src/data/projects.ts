The system uses an ESP32 with dual ultrasonic sensors to detect user presence and measure bin fill level. A servo motor automatically opens and closes the lid, while LED indicators show bin status. The bin auto-locks when usage reaches 90%. The firmware communicates over MQTT (HiveMQ) using JSON payloads, sending telemetry, logs, and state updates. A custom Node-RED dashboard provides real-time monitoring including fill percentage, LED color, last trigger timestamp, bin location, and admin controls. My contribution focused on ESP32 firmware development, sensor fusion, servo control logic, MQTT integration, telemetry payloads, NTP time-sync management, and building the complete Node-RED dashboard UI.",
